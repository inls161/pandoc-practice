I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

#What tools have you we worked with so far in this class? 
1. The *command line* 
2. **github**
3. ~~Markdown~~
4. *_jekyll_* and 
5. **Pandoc!**

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
**_Pandoc!_**

### Why? 
I think it is going to form a great bridge between all the things we are doing, or at least what we've done and the things we're about to do. That might be a given, but it's not insignificant.

#### What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
The *combination* of Github and other tools. 

##### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? 
Assimilating two *different* **languages** side by side was problematic for a while. It took some practice and continues to.

###### What tools would you like to learn more about? 
I think _Pandoc_ is the most exciting tool yet, but then again, it's the **new** tool, so that might make it ~~artificially~~ *shiny.*

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
