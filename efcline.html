<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>

<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<ul>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>git and GitHub</li>
<li>Cloud9</li>
<li>pandoc</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h2>
<p>Probably GitHub and Cloud9, with due consideration for the HTML/CSS/Markdown trio.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I think Cloud9 and Github are <em>great!</em> I have to create a website for another class and I am hoping to convince my group we can use these tools to make an awesome website together. HTML I remember a lot from high school days, but it is valuable to know CSS and Markdown (so superior to HTML) as well.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>So far <strong>pandoc</strong> has been the most difficult.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>It's the newest tool in our bag, thus making it the strangest at this point in the semester, but I hope that in due time I will figure it out.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll! Seems like a great tool and we've only talked about it a little so far.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
