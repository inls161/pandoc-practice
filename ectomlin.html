<h2 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h2>
<p>So far we have used tools such as * GitHub * C9 * Pandoc * Markdown * HTML * Command Line</p>
<h2 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h2>
<p>** So far I have found GitHub the most potentially useful. **</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>** I have found GitHub the most useful due to its ability to host and share source files with your peers which helps facilitate collaboration. **</p>
<h2 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The most difficult tool to learn was the command line in the very beggining of class. This is because it was like learning a new language that I had never heard before. It took some getting used to all of the commands and what they meant but eventually they began to all make sense. *</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h2>
<p>** The tool that I would like to learn more about would be HTML because it seems to have so many usful applications in web development which I would love to become more proficient in. **</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
