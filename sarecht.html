<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h2>
<p>So far we have worked with :</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Cloud9</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
<li>Computer languages (CSS, html, javascript)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h3>
<p>I think that all of these are potentially extremely useful.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>GitHub and Cloud9 can be used in many different ways, so there are many applications and uses for them. I know that html, CSS, and javascript are also extremely useful for creating and formatting webpages.</p>
<h3 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h3>
<p>The commands in Cloud9 have been the most difficult to learn.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h3>
<p>They have been the most difficult because it is a lot of memorization. The memorization aspect is made easier by frequently practicing the commands, though.</p>
<h3 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h3>
<p>I would like to learn more about javascript and html because I think they are very powerful tools that I could use in any job I have in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
