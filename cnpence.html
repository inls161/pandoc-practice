<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>CodeAnywhere</li>
<li>Languages (HTML, Markdown, etc.)</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Jekyll ## Which have you found most potentially useful? Jekyll and CodeAnywhere (as a team) ### Why? You can use the two together to make a legit website, and that is a <strong>super</strong> profitable skill! # What tools have been the most difficult to learn? CSS and CodeAnywhere (as a team) ## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? They require a lot of trial and error in order to get the site to look <em>just</em> right, and I'm so impatient that it takes all my willpower not to make 5384738 different edits and <em>then</em> commit and push them. # What tools would you like to learn more about?</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>BASH</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of job applications I've been running through require one or more of these skills in order to apply! * * *</p>
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
