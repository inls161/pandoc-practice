<p>What tools have you we worked with so far in this class? 1. The <em>command line</em> 2. <strong>github</strong> 3. <del>Markdown</del> 4. <em><em>jekyll</em></em> and 5. <strong>Pandoc!</strong></p>
<h1 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h1>
<p><strong><em>Pandoc!</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<h3 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h3>
<p>The <em>combination</em> of Github and other tools.</p>
<h4 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h4>

<h5 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h5>
<p>I think <em>Pandoc</em> is the most exciting tool yet, but then again, it's the <strong>new</strong> tool, so that might make it <del>artificially</del> <em>shiny.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
