I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

#What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

We have worked with *all* of these tools:

* GitHub
* Cloud9
* Markdown
* CSS
* HTML

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

I've found that knowledge of **GitHub** has been the most useful because it can incorporate into it usage of all the other tools mentioned before. 

### Why? 

GitHub has the power to keep track of all the different versions of code that one could accumulate when working on a project. 

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

Keeping track of all of the different markup languages can be hard sometimes. 

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

For instance, Markdown, HTML, and CSS **all** have similar functions but they are executed by different commands.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

I'd love to learn more about CSS to be able to add cool features to a website.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
