I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
*Jekyll,* *github,* *codeanywhere,* *pandoc,* and several text languages.
## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
*github* is probably the most potentially useful for me, along with the *codeanywhere* addition.
### Why? 
The ease with which documents can be **edited** and **saved** and **distributed** to potential editors and critics will make it easier to produce academic material in the future.  
#### What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
*Jekyll* has been the most difficult for me to pick up on.
##### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
I have no **experience** with editing websites and **altering** the code that makes it operate.
###### What tools would you like to learn more about?
I would like to learn more about *Jekyll* and the specifics of **altering** code with various *text languages.*

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
