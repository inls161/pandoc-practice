<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<p>We have worked these tools: * GitHub * Cloud9 * Markdown * CSS * HTML</p>
<h2 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h2>
<p>I've found that knowledge of GitHub has been the most useful because it can incorporate into it usage of all the other tools mentioned before.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>GitHub has the power to keep track of all the different versions of code that one could accumulate when working on a project.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>Keeping track of all of the different markup languages can be hard sometimes.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>For instance, Markdown, HTML, and CSS all have similar functions but they are executed by different commands.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I'd love to learn more about CSS to be able to add cool features to a website.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
