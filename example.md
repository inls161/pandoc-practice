I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

* CSS
* HTML
* Markdown
* git and GitHub
* Cloud9
* pandoc
* Jekyll 

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

Probably GitHub and Cloud9, with due consideration for the HTML/CSS/Markdown trio.

### Why? 

I think Cloud9 and Github are *great!* I have to create a website for another class and I am hoping to convince my group we can use these tools to make an awesome website together.
HTML I remember a lot from high school days, but it is valuable to know CSS and Markdown (so superior to HTML) as well.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

So far **pandoc** has been the most difficult.

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

It's the newest tool in our bag, thus making it the strangest at this point in the semester, but I hope that in due time I will figure it out.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

* Jekyll! Seems like a great tool and we've only talked about it a little so far.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
