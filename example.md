I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
In this class I have worked with GitHub, Linux/Unix, Markdown, Pandoc, and Jekyll.

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
I have found GitHub and Linux/Univ to be the most useful so far.

### Why?
If you are able to use GitHub effectively, you can become a better collaborator in the workforce environment. 
With Linux/Unix, I have enjoyed being able to use a remote terminal to access local work that is on my computer and then execute any changes that I've made.

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
I would say that Linx/Unix has been the most difficult to learn.

### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
It's like learning a new lanugage. You have to understand the syntax, what everything does, and then how to use it appropriately.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
Since I want to go into database and *possibly* systems analysis, I am excited to learn about SQL and other database manipulation and querying languages.
I will be teaching myself Python (I know we are not going to cover this in this class).

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
