I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

- Git
- GitHub
    - GitHub Pages
- Cloud9
- Markdown
- Jekyll
- Pandoc

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

- **Markdown!!**

### Why? 

It makes it _soooo much easier_ to format html and XML and more I'm probably not aware of yet!

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

- GitHub, particularly pulling and merging

### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

Having two versions of my repository (the one on GitHub and the local one) trips me up. 

## What tools would you like to learn more about?

Pandoc and any tools needed to use it in my work. It seems like it could be a very powerful tool if I understood the process better.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
