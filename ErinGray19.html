<p><em>Cloud9</em> ##Why? <em>Cloud9 allows me to work with the command line which can be used in a variety of different languages and programs</em> #What tools have been the most difficult to learn? <em>Pandoc and Github</em> ##Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? <em>We haven't had much time in Pandoc just yet, I'm sure it will get more clear. Github has been difficult because it can do so many things that I'm not sure of yet</em> #What tools would you like to learn more about? <em>I would love to learn more on Github and with Cloud9!</em> * * *</p>
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
