I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

Github, Codeanywhere, Terminal, Jekyll, Pandoc, HTML, CSS

## Which have you found most potentially useful?

Working in the Terminal and learning how to operate on the command line. 

## Why?

Although it was difficult at first, it makes organizing things a lot easier. It has also allowed me to visualize in my head how things are organized on a computer, whereas before it was almost magical. This is a skill that I see myself using after this class, and even after college.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn?

Github has been the most difficult tool for me to learn.

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

There is a lot of terminology associated with Github that I am not familiar with yet. Sometimes I will get lost on the user interface because I do not know exactly where to look for what I need. However, as the session progresses, I am getting more comfortable using it, and I definitely see the value in using it.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

Pandoc and CSS

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
