I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 

    Cloud 9

## Why? 
    
    It has been proven to be the most helpful because I have actually used it out of class for other projects.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
    
    At the moment none have been too difficult, although at first each were intimidating to learn. 

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

    The only issue was actually using the tool and learning how to properly use it. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

    Jekyll seems like an awesome tool I want to learn more about.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
