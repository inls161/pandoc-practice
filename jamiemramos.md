I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you /we worked with so far in this class?
* GitHub
* Cloud9
* Jekyll
* HTML 
* Markdown
* Pandoc
* Command Line

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
I have found *Jekyll* the most useful **so far**.

### Why? 
Jekyll provides many different shells of websites that I could use/modify to make my own. I've tried making websites several times, but I always got stuck on design. This would allow me to be able to produce something visually appealing *without giving up halfway through*.

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
I'm not sure any of these could be compared in levels of difficult. 

### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
Because they've all been so different. They all have had their own struggles, and once you factor out knowing other things that help you learn the next thing, they're really all equally difficult.

## What tools would you like to learn more about?
I'd like to learn more about *Pandoc* because it seems like something I've been needing, but I still don't fully understand it.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
