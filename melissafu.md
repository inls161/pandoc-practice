I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

* Codeanywhere
* Git/Github
* Markdown/HTML/CSS
* Pandoc

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

Github

## Why? 

It allows me to access my files from *any* computer and through different platforms either on the web or through a terminal. I can also easily build off other source codes directly from github.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

Codeanywhere

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

I understand the basic commands, but it's difficult remembering all the different formats and conventions without a reference sheet.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

I remember someone mentioning creating chatbots on Slack during our virtual session and I would be interested in learning a bit more about how they work since I'm not familiar with the code behind them at all.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
