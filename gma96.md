I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer
format using Markdown.

Turn all of the questions below into headers.
=============================================

If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown
    syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists.

2.  Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

GitHub Username: gma96 Team name: gitpub\
 Today's date: 10/12/16

What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
========================================================

-   Github
-   Cloud 9
-   Markdown
-   CSS
-   HTML
-   Linux commands

Which have you found most potentially useful?
---------------------------------------------

Learning how to use *Github* seems to be the most potentially useful.
Learning *markdown, css, and html* ties into this as well.

Why?
----

I thought these tools were the most useful because in the future I might
run into jobs that might ask me to create or edit websites and these
skills and tools will help me get successfully complete those tasks.

What tools have been the most difficult to learn?
=================================================

Learning *linux commands* has been the most difficult to learn.

Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
-----------------------------------------------------------

It's difficult because there are so many different commmands and its
hard to remember which ones do what. In addition to the many commands,
there are also flags that makes it even more complicated.

What tools would you like to learn more about?
==============================================

I'd like to work a little more with web design and customization because
there are many different possibilities that we haven't worked with yet


***When you are finished with the questions in file:***

1.  I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.
2.  You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and
    ODT formats, per the instructions in class.
3.  Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.
4.  Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files
    back into my original repository.
