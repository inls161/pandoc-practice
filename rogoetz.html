<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>
<h1 id="turn-all-of-the-questions-below-into-headers.">Turn all of the questions below into headers.</h1>
<h2 id="if-the-questions-are-related-make-the-headers-reflect-this-by-subordinating-them.">If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text for emphasis in your responses.</p></li>

<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<p>we have worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>pandoc (most recently)</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>also technically HTML, but not really</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
<li>Git and Github</li>
<li>Codeanywhere</li>
<li>in this we learned Linux <strong>command lines</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm counting tools in terms of the toolchain vocabulary we learned on Day 1, as a program we learned, not the tricks within each of those programs</p>
<h2 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h2>
<p>I enjoyed learning how to create a website through Jekyll. I think Github is <em>ingenious</em> as well. Codeanywhere is also very useful, and I think Slack would be if I spent much time on it.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I just explained all of this, more or less. <em>or did I?</em></p>
<h2 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h2>
<p>I don't understand Pandoc yet, it does not have a space in my brain. And Markdown is useful, but <em>very</em> confusing sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h3>
<p><strong>lots</strong> of these tools are finicky and require a lot of memorization and/or looking up, which I'm not used to. It's also sometimes difficult to figure out how to use the tools. Sometimes the class goes too fast, and</p>
<p>John is talking before I actually finish the first thing, and then I get confused.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I need to learn more about HTML instead of just cheating and using Markdown (this is something my boss wants.)</p></li>
<li><p>I also want to learn more about website building and stuff.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
