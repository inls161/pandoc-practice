I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
* Cloud9
* github
* Markdown
* Texlive
* HTML
* CSS

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
**All** of the tools are useful because their functions and relevance overlap. By using all of them simultaneously, we can effectively convey our ideas and time manage. 

### Why? 
I particularly like using cloud9 and github because it's way easy to digest than diving right into coding.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
They all are about the same difficulty. Application is everything, so I've learned a lot from troubleshooting in comparison to reading about it.

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
Since I have minimum previous exposure, learning to use these tools is comparable to learning to use physical tools, such as a chainsaw, for the first time. Obviously there's always a learning curve but indiviuals with previous exposure come equipped with an intuitive sense.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
*I want to build a website* so any tools relevant to that would be useful.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
