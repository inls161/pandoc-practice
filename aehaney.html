<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The <strong>most</strong> useful tools have been learning how to use github and cloud 9 together. It's been interesting having the opportunity to create my own website and seeing how these two tools would work together to customize and run the actual site.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>As silly as it may sound, the linux commands were <em>originally</em> the most difficult. It's not because the commands are necessarily difficult in themselves, but because I was so nervous about learning how to do everything. I essentially psyched myself and made it more difficult than it needed to be. HTML is also pretty difficult, but that's largely based off of lack of experience.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>Out of the list, I'm interested in learning more about the commands as well as css and markdown. These all seem to be building blocks to essentially being able to rock the internet.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
