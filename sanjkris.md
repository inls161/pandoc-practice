I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

The tools we have worked with include **Github** and **Cloud9**. Within these systems, we have learned how to use *Markdown*, *branching*, and *css*.

Which have you found most potentially useful? 

Working with *Markdown* has been the most useful.

Why? 

It teaches you how to format text.

What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

*Branching* was difficult to understand at first.

Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

It had many steps, and I was confused about the order of which to do things.

What tools would you like to learn more about?

I would like to learn more about working with *css*.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
