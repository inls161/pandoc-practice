I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
So far we have worked with :
    * GitHub
    * Cloud9
    * Pandoc
    * Computer languages (CSS, html, javascript)

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
I think that all of these are potetntially extremely useful.


### Why? 
GitHub and Cloud9 can be used in many different ways, so there are many applications and uses for them.
I know that html, CSS, and javascript are also extremely useful for creating and
formatting webpages.
#### What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
The commands in Cloud9 have been the most difficult to learn.
##### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
They have been the most difficult because it is a lot of memorization. The memorization
aspect is made easier by frequently practicing the commands, though.
###### What tools would you like to learn more about?
I would like to learn more about javascript and html because I think they are very 
powerful tools that I could use in any job I have in the future.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
