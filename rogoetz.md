I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

we have worked with: 

* pandoc (most recently)
* Markdown 
  * also technically HTML, but not really
* Slack 
* Jekyll
* Git and Github
* Codeanywhere
*   in this we learned Linux **command lines**

I'm counting tools in terms of the toolchain vocabulary we learned on Day 1, as a program we learned, not the tricks within each of those programs 

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

I enjoyed learning how to create a website through Jekyll. I think Github is *ingenious* as well. Codeanywhere is also very useful, and I think Slack would be if I spent much time on it. 

### Why? 

I just explained all of this, more or less. *or did I?*

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

I don't understand Pandoc yet, it does not have a space in my brain. And Markdown is useful, but *very* confusing sometimes. 

### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

**lots** of these tools are finicky and require a lot of memorization and/or looking up, which I'm not used to. It's also sometimes difficult to figure out how to use the tools. Sometimes the class goes too fast, and 

John is talking before I actually finish the first thing, and then I get confused. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

1. I need to learn more about HTML instead of just cheating and using Markdown (this is something my boss wants.)

2. I also want to learn more about website building and stuff.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
