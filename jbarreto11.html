<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p><strong>HTML, CSS, and Markdown</strong> have been the most difficult to use when in the context of a <strong>Jekyll Template.</strong> ## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? One must identify which language is being used in each part of the template so that one is able to <em>accurately</em> edit the template.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I would like to learn more about how to edit different Jekyll templates and if there are other website templates that are not Jekyll. * * *</p>
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
