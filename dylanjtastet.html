<li>Unix</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I use <strong>Unix</strong> commands heavily in my computer science classes, and <strong>Git</strong> lets me <em>version control</em> my assignments so I don't brick them.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p><strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> were difficult to learn because there are a lot of tags to memorize in their <em>schemas</em>. <strong>Git</strong> was challenging to learn because it can cause a lot of crazy <em>side effects</em> if commands aren't formatted correctly.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I would like to learn about <strong>Javascript</strong> and other <em>web programming</em> tools so that I can build <em>interactive</em> web pages.</p>

<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
