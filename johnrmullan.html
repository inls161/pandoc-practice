<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>
<h1 id="turn-all-of-the-questions-below-into-headers.">Turn all of the questions below into headers.</h1>
<h2 id="if-the-questions-are-related-make-the-headers-reflect-this-by-subordinating-them.">If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text for emphasis in your responses.</p></li>

<li>Git</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
<li>And More!</li>

<h1 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h1>
<p>I think using Git will be the most useful.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Git allows for team collaboration to be much more efficient. It helps keep overlapping and repetition from happening, which is a huge burden on productivity.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>I think learning about building our website has been the most difficult.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>It has been difficult because I don't really fully understand how I can create new navigation, upload local files instead of links, create additional blog areas, link to other parts of my site, etc.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I really want to learn more about HTML5 and Markdown and how that relates to building my website. I really want to build my website and use it as an asset for future career prospects.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
