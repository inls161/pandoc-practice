<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>It allows me to access my files from <em>any</em> computer and through different platforms either on the web or through a terminal. I can also easily build off other source codes directly from github.</p>

<p>Codeanywhere</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>I understand the basic commands, but it's difficult remembering all the different formats and conventions without a reference sheet.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I remember someone mentioning creating chatbots on Slack during our virtual session and I would be interested in learning a bit more about how they work since I'm not familiar with the code behind them at all.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
