<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<p>In this class we have worked with <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Cloud9</strong> primarily. Through these we have learned Markdown, HTML, CSS and some Linux.</p>
<h1 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h1>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I found learning about GitHub the most interesting and useful. I never knew what an open source site was like before and how it would be benefitial. Even if I never use it again learning about GitHub has expanded my tech vocabulary and understanding.</p>

<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>For me, learning Markdown and HTML has been the most difficult. It just doesn't come naturally to me to remember what each sysmbol does to change the text styles. I think Markdown and HTML have been the most difficult because it is so many little things to memorize. It's more like learning a whole new language. The git commands are more intuative.</p>

<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
