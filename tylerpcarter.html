<pre><code>I really love Github and CodeAnywhere as tools to use in my life.</code></pre>
<p>## Why? I have many uses for CodeAnywhere, as I am constantly using different devices. I've always relied on a physical drive. GitHub seems very collaborative and I have no doubt GitHub will be a valuable repository for me to use in resume work.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<pre><code>So far, navigating the terminal has been the most difficult to learn. Pandoc and text editor work is a closesecond.</code></pre>
<h1 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h1>
<pre><code>Many of the commands on the terminal window are not intuitive. I don&#39;t have any knowledge of the acronyms. The command sudo, for example, having not used it many times yet, is hard to remember. 
Markdown and html is the same exact way for me. I do not have the programming knowledge, yet.</code></pre>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<pre><code>I really want to learn more about web and app development. I&#39;d like to use HTML and incorporate scripting and Swift/Java for development platforms.</code></pre>
