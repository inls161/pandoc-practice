<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>
<h1 id="turn-all-of-the-questions-below-into-headers.">Turn all of the questions below into headers.</h1>
<h2 id="if-the-questions-are-related-make-the-headers-reflect-this-by-subordinating-them.">If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists.</p></li>

<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>Unix Commands</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h2>
<p>I have found GitHub and Unix to be the most useful so far.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are able to use GitHub effectively, you can become a better collaborator in the workforce environment.</li>
<li>With Linux/Unix, I have enjoyed being able to use a remote terminal to access local work that is on my computer and then execute any changes that I've made.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h2>
<p>I would say that Linx/Unix has been the most difficult to learn.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h3>
<p>It's like learning a new lanugage. You have to understand the syntax, what everything does, and then how to use it appropriately.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>Since I want to go into database and <em>possibly</em> systems analysis, I am excited to learn about SQL and other database manipulation and querying languages. I will be teaching myself Python (I know we are not going to cover this in this class).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
