I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

* Team name: Team Alpha

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
* Git
* Markdown
* HTML5
* Jekyll
* And More! 

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 
I think using Git will be the most useful.

## Why? 
Git allows for team collaboration to be much more efficient.  It helps keep overlapping and repetition from happening, which is a huge burden on productivity. 

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
I think learning about building our website has been the most difficult. 

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
It has been difficult because I don't really fully understand how I can create new navigation, upload local files instead of links, create additional blog areas, link to other parts of my site, etc. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
I really want to learn more about HTML5 and Markdown and how that relates to building my website. I really want to build my website and use it as an asset for future career prospects.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
