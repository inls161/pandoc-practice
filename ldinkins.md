I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?
In this class we have worked with **GitHub** and **Cloud9** primarily. Through these
we have learned Markdown, HTML, CSS and some Linux. 

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 
## Why? 
I found learning about GitHub the most interesting and useful. I never knew what an 
open source site was like before and how it would be benefitial. Even if I never use it again
learning about GitHub has expanded my tech vocabulary and understanding.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
For me, learning Markdown and HTML has been the most difficult. It just doesn't come naturally to me to remember
what each sysmbol does to change the text styles. I think Markdown and HTML have been the most difficult because it is so many little things to memorize. 
It's more like learning a whole new language. The git commands are more intuative. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

* HTML

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
