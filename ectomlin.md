# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

## What tools have you we worked with so far in this class? ##
So far we have used tools such as 
* GitHub
* C9
* Pandoc 
* Markdown
* HTML
* Command Line

## Which have you found most potentially useful? ##
** So far I have found GitHub the most potentially useful. **

### Why? ###
** I have found GitHub the most useful due to its ability to host and share source files with your peers which helps facilitate collaboration. **

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? ##
* The most difficult tool to learn was the command line in the very beggining of class. This is because it was like learning a new language that I had never heard before. It took some getting used to all of the commands and what they meant but eventually they began to all make sense. *

## What tools would you like to learn more about? ##
** The tool that I would like to learn more about would be HTML because it seems to have so many usful applications in web development which I would love to become more proficient in. **

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
