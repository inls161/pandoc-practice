I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class? 

* GitHub 
* Markdown
* Cloud 9 
* Pandoc
* Command Line

# Which have you found most potentially useful? 

GitHub

# Why? 

I can see myself building websites later and this is the best system I've ever used to do that. It also does a lot of other things too. 

## What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

**Everything**, **everything** has been difficult. That's not a cop-out, it's just true.

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? 

Everything has different and extensive rules and is built using a language I've never used before. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about? 

I would like to learn more about Pandoc because I think it will help me write my thesis later. *Tries not to freak out about thesis*

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
