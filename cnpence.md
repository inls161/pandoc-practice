* CodeAnywhere
* Languages (HTML, Markdown, etc.)
* CSS
* Jekyll

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 
Jekyll and CodeAnywhere (as a team)

### Why? 
You can use the two together to make a legit website, and that is a **super** profitable skill!

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
CSS and CodeAnywhere (as a team)

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
They require a lot of trial and error in order to get the site to look *just* right, and I'm so impatient that it takes all my willpower not to make 5384738 different edits and *then* commit and push them. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
* Java
* BASH
* HTML 

A lot of job applications I've been running through require one or more of these skills in order to apply!

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
