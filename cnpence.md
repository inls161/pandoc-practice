# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
CSS and CodeAnywhere (as a team)

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?
They require a lot of trial and error in order to get the site to look *just* right, and I'm so impatient that it takes all my willpower not to make 5384738 different edits and *then* commit and push them. 

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
* Java
* BASH
* HTML 

A lot of job applications I've been running through require one or more of these skills in order to apply!
