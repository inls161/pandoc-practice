I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?

* git
* github
* html
* css
* unix Shell
* jekyll
* c9
* pandoc 
* markdown

## Which have you found most potentially useful? 

* Unix
* Git

### Why? 

I use **Unix** commands heavily in my computer science classes, and **Git** lets me *version control* my assignments 
so I don't brick them.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. Git

## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?

**CSS** and **HTML** were difficult to learn because there are a lot of tags to memorize in their *schemas*. **Git** was challenging to learn because
it can cause a lot of crazy *side effects* if commands aren't formatted correctly.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?

I would like to learn about **Javascript** and other *web programming* tools so that I can build <em>interactive</em> web pages.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
