<li>Git</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>

<li>Pandoc</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Git</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why"><em>Why?</em></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Git: It's a really powerful tool for collaboration and gathering metadata.</li>
<li>HTML/CSS: I used HTML/CSS about a year ago and then didn't use it after that until this class. Going over things in class made me remember a whole bunch of things, and it also made me realize how much more I could learn. That was really cool.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>CSS took the longest amount of time to learn, but pandoc is the newest to me. I would say that pandoc is the most difficult to learn just because I've never encountered it before.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use"><em>Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</em></h2>
<p>The website was already set up with some style pieces in obscure areas of the file, making CSS hard to learn. Pandoc is the newest to me, so it's therefore the most difficult.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I'd like to learn more about Javascript.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
