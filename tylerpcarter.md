I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown. 

# Turn all of the questions below into headers. 

## If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.  

1. For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists. 

2. Use **bold** and *italic* text for emphasis in your responses.

# What tools have you worked with so far in this class? So far I have worked with Github, CodeAnywhere, Ruby, Jekyll, HTML5, Markdown Converters, Plaintext Editors, Slack, and Pandoc.

# Which have you found most potentially useful?
	I really love Github and CodeAnywhere as tools to use in my life.

  ## Why? I have many uses for CodeAnywhere, as I am constantly using different devices. 
	I've always relied on a physical drive. GitHub seems very collaborative and I have no doubt GitHub will be a valuable repository for me to use in resume work.

# What tools have been the most difficult to learn? 
	So far, navigating the terminal has been the most difficult to learn. Pandoc and text editor work is a closesecond.

# Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? 
	Many of the commands on the terminal window are not intuitive. I don't have any knowledge of the acronyms. The command sudo, for example, having not used it many times yet, is hard to remember. 
	Markdown and html is the same exact way for me. I do not have the programming knowledge, yet.

# What tools would you like to learn more about?
	I really want to learn more about web and app development. I'd like to use HTML and incorporate scripting and Swift/Java for development platforms.

***When you are finished with the questions in file:*** 

1. I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username. 
2. You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in  class. 
3. Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes. 
4. Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.
