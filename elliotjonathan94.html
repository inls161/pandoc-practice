<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<p><em>Jekyll,</em> <em>github,</em> <em>codeanywhere,</em> <em>pandoc,</em> and several text languages. ## Which have you found most potentially useful? <em>github</em> is probably the most potentially useful for me, along with the <em>codeanywhere</em> addition. ### Why? The ease with which documents can be <strong>edited</strong> and <strong>saved</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong> to potential editors and critics will make it easier to produce academic material in the future.<br />#### What tools have been the most difficult to learn? <em>Jekyll</em> has been the most difficult for me to pick up on. ##### Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? I have no <strong>experience</strong> with editing websites and <strong>altering</strong> the code that makes it operate. ###### What tools would you like to learn more about? I would like to learn more about <em>Jekyll</em> and the specifics of <strong>altering</strong> code with various <em>text languages.</em> * * *</p>
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
